This package creates a .zip file containing your package and its dependencies, including
transitive dependencies.

The code was forked from [node-pack-zip](https://github.com/Merlin-Taylor/node-pack-zip)
which did not support transitive dependencies (see [issue#2](https://github.com/Merlin-Taylor/node-pack-zip/issues/2)).

It was mainly designed to help deploy nodejs packages in AWS lambdas.

The .zip file will contain by default
- All files not in `node_modules`
- All files in `node_modules` that are part of a package listed in the `dependencies` field of your `package.json` and
all their transitives dependencies

## Installation

`npm install --save-dev repack-zip`

## Example

_my-lambda_ is an npm package I want to run as an AWS Lambda Function.

Install _repack-zip_ locally in _my-lambda_
```
npm install --save-dev repack-zip
```

Install any runtime dependencies of _my-lambda_.
```
npm install
```

Modify _my-lambda/package.json_:
```
"scripts": {
    "build-aws-lambda": "repack-zip"
    ...
}
```

Create the .zip file containing _my-lambda_ and all its dependencies, ready to be uploaded to AWS Lambda
```
npm run build-aws-lambda
```

## Configuration
You can customize included and excluded glob patterns using a `repackZipConfig`
section in your package.json

Ex:
```$xslt
"repackZipConfig": {
  "includes": [ ...list of include glob patterns...],
  "excludes": [ ...list of exclude glob patterns...]
```
